# ðŸš€ Excited to Share My Latest Project! ðŸš€

* I've been diving into TypeScript recently and decided to put my skills to the test by creating a simple calculator. This project was a great way to practice and reinforce my understanding of TypeScript, HTML, and CSS.

### ðŸ”¢ Project Highlights:

* Built a fully functional calculator.
* Utilized TypeScript for type-safe coding and error reduction.
* Enhanced the user interface with HTML and CSS.
## ðŸ›  Tech Stack:

* TypeScript: Leveraged for adding static typing to JavaScript.
HTML: Structured the calculator's interface.
CSS: Styled the calculator for a clean and user-friendly look.
This project has not only improved my TypeScript skills but also given me a deeper appreciation for the power of static typing in front-end development.
